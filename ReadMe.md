# PostCounter

PostCounter is a BakkesMod plugin that counts the amount of posts you hit in a given session (from boot). It tracks in both Freeplay, Custom Training, and Online games but only for the Soccar gamemode. It will only track the shot if the player running the plugin had the last touch on the ball, and it only counts the initial shot from the player. The stats can be reset using the console command 'ResetShotCounterStats', or the button in the GUI. Expanded stats are available in the BakkesMod plugin GUI.

WIP Features:<br />
-> Long term storage of shot history per session<br />
-> Shot heatmaps/recommendations<br />
-> Customizable post radius<br />
