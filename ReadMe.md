# PostCounter

PostCounter is a BakkesMod plugin that counts the amount of posts you hit in a given session (from boot). It tracks in both Freeplay, Custom Training, and Online games. It will only track the shot if the player running the plugin had the last touch on the ball, and it only counts the initial shot from the player. The stats can be reset using the console command 'ResetShotCounterStats'.
